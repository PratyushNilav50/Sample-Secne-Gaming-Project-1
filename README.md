SPAWNING WAVE OF ENEMIES” is a simple modification of the 2D shooter game made on Unity Game Engine that was taught to us in the summer training program ‘Game Development using Unity’ through Coursera.
During summer training, we were thinking about four important prospects for game designing and development. After completion of the training, The 2d shooter genre is very famous among which fall games like Galaga etc. 
It has evolved to a great extent over time and will keep on evolving. In this project, I used the Unity editor and downloaded certain Assets from the Asset store to create the game. 
This is a 2-dimensional game where the player can only move in any direction, steer, and can shoot the enemies. The main task of the player is to defeat all the enemies present and progress to the next level. 
There are 3 different levels with increasing levels of difficulty.
I have used the predefined scripts given to us during the training in C# language to make the game. This game has limitless future scopes which are yet to be discovered and used
